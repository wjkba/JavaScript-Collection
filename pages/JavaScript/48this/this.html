          this keyword refers to the current execution context. It's often used
          within functions and methods to access or manipulate the properties
          and methods of the object that the function is bound to. The exact
          value of this depends on how the function is called or where it's
          defined. It plays a crucial role in object-oriented programming and
          helps determine the context in which code is executed.
