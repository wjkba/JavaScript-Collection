          window object represents the global window or browser environment in
          which your code is running. It serves as the top-level object, and
          many global properties, functions, and methods are attached to it.
          window provides access to various browser-related features and allows
          you to interact with the browser, manipulate the webpage's content,
          handle events, and more. It's a fundamental part of client-side web
          development and is used to control and manage the browser window and
          its interactions with the web page.
